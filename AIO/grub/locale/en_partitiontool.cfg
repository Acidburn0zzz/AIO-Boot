Partition Tools

The "Partition Tools" menu of AIO Boot supports automatic listing of partitions and gives you options like these. It also supports you to Delete Partition, Backup MBR and Restore MBR.

From the Grub2 menu, press the "n" key to access the "Partition Tools" menu. You will see all the partitions on this disk.
Here, select a partition to perform the tasks you want.

Delete partition

If you use PartIMG Mapper to MAP ISO and PartIMG files into new partitions, you should delete them after you have used them.

You can not delete the current root partition, to delete the root partition, you need to set another partition as the root partition. From the Grub2 main menu, press the "y" key to list the partitions that can be set as the root partition. You can change the root partition if you install the AIO Boot on multiple partitions, or use the "FAT32 & NTFS" option of the AIO Boot Extractor. If you install AIO Boot on only one partition, use "PartIMG Mapper" to MAP the "PartIMG_ROOT.img" file, then you can set this new partition as the root partition.

Please note:
	* If you want to delete the real partition, please Backup MBR first. You can then Restore MBR as before Backup.
	* MBR information is only stored on the current root partition. If you change the root partition, you need to back up the MBR on that partition.
	* If you update to the new version of AIO Boot, the PartIMG_ROOT.img file is overwritten. If you previously used this file as the root partition, the backup information will be lost, please back up the MBR each time this file is overwritten.
	* This menu is only visible on USB. If you want to use on HDD, please create a file named "FORCEHDD" in folder "/AIO/Tools".
