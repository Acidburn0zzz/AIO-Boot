Introduction

Partition Image Mapper is a tool that allows you to temporarily use the partition image as a real partition. PartIMG Mapper is similar, please refer to Partition Image Mapper for more details.

PartIMG Mapper is designed to help users to use it directly on Grub2 without having to boot into Windows. This is a Grub2 menu, but it does use Grub4dos to do some work. But Grub4dos does not support UEFI, you need to boot into Grub2 in Legacy BIOS mode to use this menu. And PartIMG Mapper only supports MBR disks, not GPT disks. The advantage of it is that you can use it directly from the Grub2 menu without having an operating system.

PartIMG Mapper supports ISO files, which can help you boot most Linux operating systems from ISO.

However, it is possible that the Linux distribution you want to boot supports booting from the ISO file. From the main menu of Grub2, press the "j" key to access the "Boot from ISO, WIM, IMG, VHD and IMA files" menu. If the ISO file is supported here, you do not need to use the "PartIMG Mapper" menu.

This menu is only visible on USB. If you want to use on HDD, please create a file named "FORCEHDD" in folder "/AIO/Tools".

PartIMG Mapper

1. First, you need to copy all the PartIMG and ISO files into the /AIO/Files/PartIMG folder. Next, you need defrag for this folder, I use Defraggler Portable to do this.

2. Now just boot into Grub2 in Legacy BIOS mode and access the "PartIMG Mapper" menu. Press the "o" key for quick access to this menu. It will list all the files in the /AIO/Files/PartIMG directory.

3. Select the files you want to use as a real partition. From the Grub2 menu, press the "n" key to access the "Partition Tools" menu. You will see all the partitions on this disk.

4. To boot into partitions from the PartIMG and ISO files, from the Grub2 main menu, press the "k" key to access the "PartIMG Partition" menu. Here you will see the partition or configuration files such as grub.cfg, isolinux.cfg and syslinux.cfg. Select one of the partitions or configuration files to boot. If one of them can not boot, please choose another.

5. Once you have used these partitions, you should delete them.
