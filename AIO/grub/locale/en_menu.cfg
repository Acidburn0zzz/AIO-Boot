The AIO Boot menus are contained in the ".cfg" files in the "/AIO/Menu" directory.

The menu starts with "menuentry" and ends with "}".

If you want faster access to frequently used menus, copy them and paste them into the main menu in the "/AIO/Menu/Main.cfg" file.

There is always a hotkey for each menu. The hot keys are enclosed in square brackets "[KEY]", you can quickly access the menu by pressing the corresponding key of it.

I'm very grateful to you if you can translate the language of the menus:
	1. Copy the file "/AIO/grub/locale/en.cfg" to a new file.
	2. Rename this file to the name of one of the ".mo" files included in this folder.
	   Do not change the file extension. For example: "ru.cfg" and "ru.mo".
	3. Translations and email me translation: admin@aioboot.com.
