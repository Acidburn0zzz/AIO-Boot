AIO Boot supports booting Linux as well as other utilities from ISO, WIM, VHD, IMG and IMA files.

1. Just copy the ISO, WIM, VHD, IMG and IMA files to the "/AIO/Files" directory or its subfolders.
2. From the main menu of Grub2, press the j key for quick access to the "Boot from ISO, WIM, IMG, VHD and IMA files" menu.
3. Grub2 will list the files that it supports, and then you just select them to boot. The script only lists the files in the "/AIO/Files" directory and its subfolders. It will be very slow if you list all directories on your computer. For files outside of this folder, you can boot them through the "Grub2 File Manager".

For Linux ISO files, the script will automatically detect which distributions it supports. List tested (incomplete):
	* 4MParted.
	* Arch Linux.
	* Bitdefender.
	* CentOS.
	* Clonezilla.
	* Debian Live.
	* Fedora.
	* Gentoo.
	* Gparted.
	* Kali Linux.
	* Linux Lite.
	* Linux Mint.
	* Manjaro.
	* MiniTool Partition Wizard 9.1.
	* Slackware Live Edition.
	* Ubuntu.
	* WifiSlax 4.12.
	* WifiSlax64.
	* antiX.
	* gNewSense.
	* openSuse.

If not detected, the script will give you the option to boot the file with Grub4dos and MemDisk (which does not support UEFI). I used wimboot to boot WinPE 7/8/8.1/10 (.wim) and NTBOOT to boot WinPE XP (.wim) and VHD (.vhd, .vhdx) through Grub4dos. You are also provided with a menu to open files with Loopback.

However, some machines can not boot Linux from the ISO file, it needs to extract. Use AIOCreator.exe to integrate, this tool always uses extraction method if possible. It also supports creating persistent mode for supported Linux distributions. Only use ISO when you can not run AIOCreator.exe, which is useful if you are using a Linux environment.
