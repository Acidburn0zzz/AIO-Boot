For the files it supports, you can place these files anywhere on your computer and then access them for processing. You can put your ISO file (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint...) on your hard drive and boot it from AIO Boot on USB. To quickly list files, you should copy them to the /AIO/Files directory, then press the "j" key from the Grub2 menu to quickly list these files. However, I recommend that you Integrate the files through AIOCreator.exe, unless you can not run it, or you are using Linux.

From the Grub2 main menu, press "d" for quick access to the "File Manager" menu.
