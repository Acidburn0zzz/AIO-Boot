set menulong="The AIO Boot menus are contained in the \".cfg\" files in the \"/AIO/Menu\" directory.\n\nThe menu starts with \"menuentry\" and ends with \"}\".\nIf you want faster access to frequently used menus, copy them and paste them into the main menu in the \"/AIO/Menu/Main.cfg\" file.\n\nThere is always a hotkey for each menu. The hot keys are enclosed in square brackets \"[KEY]\", you can quickly access the menu by pressing the corresponding key of it.\n\nTo scan and boot into the installed operating systems on your hard drive, go to the ${oshdd} menu.\n\nYou can boot directly into UEFI mode even though your computer does not support UEFI mode.\nFirst, boot into Clover in Legacy mode, then you will see the icon to boot into rEFInd and Grub2 in UEFI mode.\n\nTo switch languages, fonts and wallpapers of Grub2, run AIOCreator.exe and go to Settings.\n\nI'm very grateful to you if you can translate the language of the menus:\n1. Copy the file /AIO/grub/locale/en.cfg to a new file.\n2. Rename this file to the name of one of the \".mo\" files included in this folder. Do not change the file extension. For example: \"ru.cfg\" and \"ru.mo\".\n3. Translations and email me translation: admin@aioboot.com."
set billong="You need to copy all your ISO files to the \"/AIO/Files/PartIMG\" folder.\nThe ISO file may be supported or not, but please try it.\n\nMost ISO files that contain the \"/boot/grub/loopback.cfg\" or \"/grub/loopback.cfg\" file will be supported."
set partimghelp="You need to copy all your ISO and PartIMG files to \"/AIO/Files/PartIMG\". Most Linux ISO files will be supported.\nThese files need to be defragmented so that they can be used.\n\nThen boot into the \"PartIMG Mapper\" menu and select a file to MAP it to a new partition.\n\nIf this disk has four partitions, delete one partition before using this feature.\nNote: Back up MBR, then you can Restore the partition table information as before.\n\nThen access the \"PartIMG Partition\" menu to boot into that partition (if it is supported)."
